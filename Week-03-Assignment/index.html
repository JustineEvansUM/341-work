        <h1>"The Creamation of Sam McGee"</h1>
        <h2>Robert Service, 1907.</h2>
        <p><i>Opening Chorus:</i></p>
        <p>There are strange things done in the midnight sun<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the men who moil for gold;</p>
        <p>The Arctic trails have their secret tales<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would make your blood run cold;</p>
        <p>The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the queerest they ever did see</p>
        <p>Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cremated Sam McGee.</p>
