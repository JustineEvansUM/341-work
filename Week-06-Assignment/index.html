    Football is an American sport of strategy and skill. American football
    evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of
    association football and rugby football. The first game of American
    football was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams,
    Rutgers and Princeton, under rules based on the association football
    rules of the time.
